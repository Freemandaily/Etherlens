# Etherlens
EtherLens is a Python library designed to provide comprehensive insights into Blockchain transactions, token balances, and gas balances associated with a specific address. This library offers a range of functionalities, including decoding transactions made by an address, fetching token balances for various ERC-20 tokens, and retrieving gas balances.

### Key Feature
- **Transaction Decoding**: Decode any blockchain **(ETH,BSC,ARB,OP,BASE,POLY)** transaction that contain similar uniswap V2 router functions and universal router like function.It gives insight on token bought,token sold,amount bought,amount sold,hash of the transction
- **Token Balance Fetching**: Fetch token balances associated with a given blockchain address for a wide range of ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to quickly ascertain their token holdings.
- **Gas Balance Retrieval**: Retrieve gas balances associated with an Ethereum address, enabling users to monitor gas usage and ensure efficient management of gas resources.
  
### Caution
⚠ This library has not been audited, and there is no pledge for one !

⚠ Might be of advantage be amiliar with general blockchain concepts and [web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) in particular.

⚠ This project is a work in progress so not all swap transction are decoded yet.
